# Summary
A collection of my recent projects, all produced as a student at Rice University's 12-week Web Development Bootcamp. This portfolio was created with a template from HTML5up, credited below. The top row of projects displayed are group projects. You can find credits for all team members in the readme file for each project. The second row of projects are homework assignments I completed by myself. This page will be updated over time with further projects as I complete them. Thanks for checking out my work!
